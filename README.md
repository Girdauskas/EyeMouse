# Intro
Controls mouse using eye and head position data from Tobii Eye Tracker 4C. My idea was to do software development without ever needing to reach a mouse. It works nicely, however, I ditched this idea because my eyes hurt after an hour of use.

# Basic idea
You look where you want to click and press activation key (capslock) without releasing it. Mouse instantly moves to the area you are looking at. Then you do micro adjustments using your head and once you release caps-lock, left click is made. 

# Advanced clicks
You can also do left/right mouse clicks while in activation mode by pressing J or K (or left/right arrow keys). For example, holding J will emulate mouse left click down, releasing J will emulate mouse left click up. This way you can select text or do drawings in paint :)

# Scrolling
You can emulate mouse wheel scrolling by holding right ALT key and slightly moving your head up or down.
